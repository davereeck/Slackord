# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: Why don't you call your tool "SlackLord"?
A: See the [glossary](./glossary.md) for the meaning of Slackord. It's about a bridge to Discord, not about just Slack.

## Q: Where can I find documentation?
We have a dedicated directory docs in the root of the github repo containing:
- [glossary](./glossary.md)
- [Error codes](./error-codes.md) explained
- This FAQ
- The [README](../README.md) traditionally is home to the installation and configuration *howto*
