## General questions
### Q: When I am having issues with Slackord, what should I do?
Please post an [issue on Github](https://github.com/thomasloupe/Slackord/issues) or forum post on Discord, but please first read the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/thomasloupe/Slackord2/wiki/Troubleshooting). 
### Q: Why don't you call your tool "SlackLord"?
A: See the [glossary](./glossary.md) for the meaning of Slackord. It's about a bridge to Discord, not about just Slack.

We have a dedicated directory `docs` in the root of the github repo containing:
- [glossary](./glossary.md)
- [Error codes](./error-codes.md) explained
- This FAQ
